•	Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to uncover patterns and insights about passenger survival rates.
•	Analyzed key variables including passenger class, gender, age, fare, and port of embarkation to determine their correlation with survival outcomes.
•	Visualized data distributions and survival trends through bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps to effectively communicate findings.
•	Handled missing data and performed data cleaning operations to prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis and accurate interpretation.
